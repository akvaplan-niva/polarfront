Code: POLARFRONT
Start: 2021-11

## Principles

POLARFRONT data mangement is based on the [transformational idea of open science][unesco-transform], the [FAIR] guidelines, and the [W3C] recommandation [Data on the Web Best Practices][dwbp].

The FAIR principles of findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable data has gained widespread traction and is now incorparated as requirements for public funding across the globe, including in Research Council of Norway's [policy for open access to research data][2].
